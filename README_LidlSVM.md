# LIDL_SVM  

### NOTES  
This is simplified SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm, that's why LIDL  
With simplified math and calculations  
With use of line equations, moving line closer to the point (Perceptron Algorithm), distance between point and line  

Line equation --> ax + by + c = 0  
Perceptron Algorithm --> look it up :)  
Distance between point and the line --> |ax + by + c| / sqrt(a ^ 2 + b ^ 2)  

For people who don't really understand the complex math for SVM, this is like a beginner level
